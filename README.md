# 🏠 Group2 – US House Price Analysis (2024)

## 📊 Real Estate Data Analytics: Insights from the U.S. Housing Market & Predictive Modeling 

This project analyzes the U.S. real estate market using a dataset of housing listings across all 50 states. Through a combination of data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive modeling, we identify trends in housing characteristics and pricing, regional differences, and assess the feasibility of price prediction models.
